-------
It should be noted that a IP address reflector hosted at my personal website
(danieru.com) is used to check the internet IP. This means that your phone will
send me a request which leaks some information into my logs:
1. Your phone's version
2. Your IP address
3. Your language
I have no intention to release this information but I cannot promise my server
will remain compromise free. In the worst case a hacker may access my logs and
in turn access your information. This information is not more extensive than
what a regular website would aquire upon your visiting it. In the case that you
do not feel comfortable with this risk please do not use this application.
Please also consider using a proxy server for your web browsing.
